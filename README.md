# FEUP-LCOM
Repository created for the LCOM course at FEUP.
The course conssists of several labs that are developed during lab classes, more info on each lab can be found bellow.
All the code in this repository was made strictly for educational purposes and you can use it as you please, just keep in mind I'm not responsibe for anything. If you are taking the LCOM course please keep in mind its strict policy in relation to copy. If you are taking the course and find yourself here in need for help, I recomend you check out my code (or any other student's) and try to figure out what's happening (using the lecture slides for example), then try to do it on your own way, using your own coding style. That's the only way you are really going to learn something! 


## Lab0 - Introduction
This lab serves as quick introduction to the course and C programming. It is also serves as a first contact with the MINIX operating system and a version control system (in my case SVN).

## Lab2 - The Timer
This is the first real lab in the LCOM course, it addresses the i8254 Timer/Counter, an I/O device that can be used to measure time intervals. It is also the first contact with programming an I/O device and using interrupts.

## Lab3 - The Keyboard 
This lab adresses the i8042 KBC controller. One of the purposes of the lab is to be able the read makecodes and breakcodes of several keys of the keyboard using interrupts. It also mixes C programming with Assembly programming for the first time in the course.

## Lab4 - The Mouse
This lab adresses the PS/2 Mouse.
